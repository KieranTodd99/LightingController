\chapter{Testing}
This testing section is used to identify how the testing phase of the project was performed. 

\section{Overall Approach to Testing}
The approach I used to testing was to use test tables to test if the program met the requirements that was created at the beginning of the project. Each test case will have:
\begin{itemize}
\item Test ID - An identifier to refer back to if needed. The ID will be displayed as TCx, with TC meaning test case and x being replaced with the number the test is e.g. TC1.

\item Reference ID - The ID of the requirement the test is testing to if complete.

\item Process - What is the process that is performed to test the requirement. If there is more than one Step to the process they are enumerated.

\item Expected Result - What would have to happen for the test case to be considered a pass.

\item Pass/Fail - Whether the test passed or failed.
\end{itemize}

The test will be split up into two different tables. One of the test tables refers to all of the tests for the code side of the program and the other is tests for the web side of the program. I have only performed tests for all of the testable requirements.  
 I have only performed test cases for all of the implemented requirements with the MoSCoW priority of M (must-have), S (should-have) and C (Could-have).
