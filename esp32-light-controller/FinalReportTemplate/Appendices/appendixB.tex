Please provide a brief summary of your project (150 word max)
The ESP32 lighting project is a piece of software that easily gives the user a way of
configuring and displaying multiple different LED and motor sequences when a condition
is met for the use in models (e.g. model trains, book nooks, etc.). The lighting controller
will have an easy-to-use web-based front end for the user to assign lighting profiles to
the different LEDs and the conditions they will start lighting up under, when and how
motors will spin, and to create and edit lighting profiles that the LEDs display.
