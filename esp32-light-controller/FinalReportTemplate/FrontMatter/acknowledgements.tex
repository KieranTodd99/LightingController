\section*{\centering Acknowledgements}

I am grateful to all of the computer science lectures that have helped during my time at Aberystwyth. Specifically I would like to thank Neil Taylor and Richard Shipman. Neil Taylor has helped me and understood me whenever I have had hard times throughout the year and has truly been a supportive head of year. Richard has been a fantastic supervisor during this project, and I am thankful for his support and advice.

I would also like to thank one of my closest friends at university, Ryan Priest, for keeping me sane (mostly) over the last 4 years.

Lastly I am grateful towards my mother who has always supported me thought my time at university and has helped me in whatever way she can.
